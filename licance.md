If you’re contributing to or extending an existing project, it’s almost always easiest to continue using that project’s license. To find its license, look for a file called LICENSE or COPYING, and skim the project’s README. If you can’t find a license, ask the maintainers.

Depending on the original project’s license, using the same license might be a requirement, not just the easiest thing to do. (See the “same license” condition of some licenses.)
